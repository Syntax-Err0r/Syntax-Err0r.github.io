## About

I am an Offensive Security Engineer with over 10 years of experience in security. I mainly run Purple Teams and Assumed Breaches but have a passion for traditional Red Teaming. For years I have told myself I would start and maintain a blog -- so hopefully I can get started and keep going :).
