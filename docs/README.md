## About

This project is built around using markdown content to make a website. 

This is great for non-developers to work on. No experience with Ruby, Jekyll, Liquid, HTML or CSS required. Those are all used internally, but you don't need to worry about that.

This repo is super light. No config needed. You don't need to setup a theme or a layout. GitHub will figure that out and will apply its standard theme to your GitHub Pages site. So will it will have a clean, white, mobile-friendly site with a heading. The limitations are covered more on these pages, such as lack of a navbar. But you can still setup links to pages, as with the Menu below.

The page you are currently viewing is `README.md` in the docs directory, with path set as `/` in the frontmatter. Alternatively, you can add `index.md` or `index.html` as your homepage. I just like how a README.md previews well in GitHub.
